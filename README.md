# Graduate-School-Entrance-Predictor

This code creates several machine learning models to predict the likelihood of someone getting accepted to graduate school based on their GRE score, TOEFL score, GPA, unversity rating, and a few other factors. I tried several different models from both sklearn and TensorFlow. I also normalized a skewed feature by trying different transformations. I also found the most optimal argument values for different models by doing grid search. Finally, I evaluated each model by measuring its accuracy, precision, and recall.
